Feature: Registration and maintenance of Users (insert, remove, update)
    As a "Dizer" employee
    I want to insert new users
    And remove existing users
    And update existing users information
    So that users could login at the "Dizer"
    And users could update theirs information at the "Dizer"

Scenario: Administrator wants to remove a User from the system
    Given I am logged in with an admin account with user "admin@dizer.com" and password "admin"
    And I am on the "Lista de Usu√°rios" page
    And I see a list of system users
    And I see the "email" user "pcsb@cin.ufpe.br"
    When I click on the "Remover" button on the "Email" user "pcsb@cin.ufpe.br" line
    And I click on "Sim"
    Then I check that the email user "pcsb@cin.ufpe.br" is no longer on the list of system users
